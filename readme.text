In Python, we usually use the pandas library for data manipulation and ta (Technical Analysis) library for generating technical indicators like Bollinger Bands. First, you'll need to have these libraries installed:

pip install pandas ta

import pandas as pd
import ta

# Assuming you have a pandas DataFrame df with a 'close' column
df = pd.DataFrame({'close': [...]})


# Prompting the user for input values (or you can directly assign them if you don't need to prompt)
lengthBB = int(input("Bollinger Bands Length: ")) or 20
src_std_choice = input("Source (just press Enter for default 'close'): ") or 'close'
mult = float(input("Multiplier: ")) or 2.0

# Using the 'ta' library to calculate the Bollinger Bands
df['basis'] = ta.trend.sma_indicator(df['close'], lengthBB)
df['upper'] = df['basis'] + mult * df[src_std_choice].rolling(window=lengthBB).std()
df['lower'] = df['basis'] - mult * df[src_std_choice].rolling(window=lengthBB).std()

# Print or manipulate the result as needed
print(df[['basis', 'upper', 'lower']])


This code assumes you have your closing prices in a pandas DataFrame df under a column named 'close'. Adjust accordingly based on your dataset. The ta library makes it easy to calculate the SMA and rolling standard deviation needed for the Bollinger Bands.

Please give me the code to retrieve closing prices in the dataframe under column named close. And be able to adjust accordingly based on the dataset

To retrieve closing prices and store them in a pandas DataFrame under a column named 'close', you first need a source for the price data. One of the common ways to do this is by using the yfinance library, which fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

Here's how you can achieve this:

Install the necessary libraries:

I'm doing crypto, binance.us is my exchange

Got it! To retrieve cryptocurrency data from Binance, you can use the python-binance library. It provides a way to interact with the Binance API and fetch the data you need.

pip install python-binance pandas

You can enter a ticker symbol, start date, and end date to retrieve the adjusted closing prices for that stock between the specified dates. The data will be stored in the df DataFrame under a column named 'close'. Adjust this code according to the specifics of your dataset or if you have other sources for the data.

from binance.client import Client
import pandas as pd

API_KEY = 'YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY'
API_SECRET = 'YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET'

# Initialize the Binance client
client = Client(API_KEY, API_SECRET)

def get_binance_data(symbol_pair, interval, start_time, end_time):
    # Fetch klines (candlestick data) from Binance
    klines = client.get_historical_klines(symbol_pair, interval, start_time, end_time)
    
    # Convert klines to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(klines, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume', 'close_time', 'quote_asset_volume', 'number_of_trades', 'taker_buy_base', 'taker_buy_quote', 'ignore'])
    
    # Convert timestamp to datetime format
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='ms')
    
    # Set timestamp as the DataFrame index
    df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)
    
    # Convert 'close' column to float
    df['close'] = df['close'].astype(float)
    
    return df[['close']]

# Example usage:
symbol_pair = input("Enter the symbol pair (e.g., BTCUSDT for Bitcoin/USDT): ")
interval = Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1DAY  # Daily data; adjust as needed
start_time = input("Enter the start date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
end_time = input("Enter the end date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")

df = get_binance_data(symbol_pair, interval, start_time, end_time)
print(df.head())  # Display the first 5 rows


Note:

Ensure that you replace 'YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET' with your actual Binance API Key and Secret.

Be cautious with your API keys. Don't hardcode them directly into scripts, especially if you plan to share or store the script. Consider using environment variables or other secure ways to handle keys.

Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1DAY specifies the interval for the candlestick data. In this example, we're fetching daily data (1d). You can adjust this interval as needed. For instance, use Client.KLINE_INTERVAL_1HOUR for hourly data.

This code will fetch the closing prices for the specified cryptocurrency pair from Binance and store them in a pandas DataFrame under the 'close' column.

// Volume Confirmation
To convert the provided Pine Script code to Python, you'll typically make use of the pandas library. The Pine Script code you provided calculates a simple moving average (SMA) of volume over a period of 20 bars and then checks if the current volume is greater than this average volume multiplied by a factor.

Here's how you can write this in Python using the pandas library:

import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'df' with a 'volume' column
# df = pd.DataFrame({'volume': [...]})

# Volume Confirmation
vol_multiplier = float(input("Volume Multiplier (default is 1.5): ") or 1.5)
avg_vol = df['volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
df['vol_condition'] = df['volume'] > avg_vol * vol_multiplier

# Print or manipulate the result as needed
print(df['vol_condition'].head())  # Display the first 5 rows of vol_condition

In this Python code:

You prompt the user for a volume multiplier with a default value of 1.5.
Calculate the 20-period SMA of volume using the .rolling(window=20).mean() method on the volume column.
Create a new column 'vol_condition' in the DataFrame that checks if the volume is greater than the average volume multiplied by the user-defined factor. This column will contain boolean values (True/False).
You would need to have the pandas library installed and ensure that your dataset (df) contains a 'volume' column for this code to work. Adjust the code as per your specific needs or dataset structure.
